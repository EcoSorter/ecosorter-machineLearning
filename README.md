# EcoSorter Machine Learing Project
This ML project is our final project for Google Bangkit Academy 2023.

**Project Background:**

Our team came up with this project after identifying the pressing need for better waste management and disposal practices to tackle the growing environmental challenges faced by communities in Indonesia. We recognized that one of the primary reasons for improper waste disposal is a lack of knowledge and awareness about the correct methods to handle different types of waste.

Motivated by our shared passion for environmental conservation and our desire to make a tangible difference in waste management practices, we decided to embark on this project to create a mobile application that simplifies waste classification and empowers users to dispose of waste responsibly.

**Machine Learning:** 


Developing a machine learning model to classify biodegradable dan non-biodegradable waste using TensorFlow. The model was developed using the transfer learning technique, we use the pre-trained model MobileNetV2 as a starting point. We adopt a fine-tuning approach to capture task-specific features. The models are deployed on a google cloud platform and can be accessed using API interface 


**Our Dataset Link:**

## Prerequisites
1. [Jupyter Notebook](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.6 or above
3. Latest version of Tensorflow 2.5 (or you can update again by rerunning .ipynb and updating models)

## How to use
1. Download dataset from Kaggle and join the splitted train dataset so your dataset will have 1 train folder only
2. Upload the dataset to your google drive
3. Open `.ipynb` with Google Colaboratory using `open in colab`
4. "Save a copy in Drive" to run and edit with your account. Click `File` > `Save a copy in Drive` in your Google Colaboratory.
5. Update the dataset path according to your dataset path in your google drive
6. Done
